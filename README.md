🏗️ **Data Warehouse & Analytics Project (SQL Server)**

Welcome to this end-to-end Data Warehouse and Analytics project, built entirely using SQL Server. This project takes raw ERP & CRM data (CSV files), cleans it, models it using star schema, and delivers SQL-powered insights into customers, sales, and products — all without dashboards!

✨ **What This Project Does**
Builds a modern data warehouse using Medallion Architecture: Bronze (raw), Silver (cleaned), and Gold (analytics-ready).
Uses ETL pipelines to load and transform data step-by-step.
Models data into fact and dimension tables for easy analysis.
Runs SQL queries to uncover customer trends, sales patterns, and product performance.

**🔧 Tools Used**

SQL Server Express + SSMS
DrawIO for architecture and schema diagrams
Notion for project planning and documentation
